# Bird Strike Analysis Between 2000-2011 Dashboard

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of bird strike incidents, where birds collide with aircraft, posing significant safety risks. The dataset used in this analysis was collected by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) from 2000 to 2011. The goal is to create a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes and analyzes these incidents to enhance aviation safety and develop effective mitigation strategies.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes detailed records of bird strikes with various attributes:

- **Airport Name**: Location of the incident.
- **Altitude**: Altitude at which the strike occurred.
- **Aircraft Make/Model**: Type of aircraft involved.
- **Number of Wildlife Struck**: Number of birds or animals involved.
- **Impact on Flight**: Effect on the flight (e.g., engine shutdown, precautionary landing).
- **Flight Date**: Date of the incident.
- **Damage Indicated**: Whether the strike caused damage to the aircraft.
- **Wildlife Size and Species**: Information on the wildlife involved.
- **Sky Conditions**: Weather conditions at the time of the strike.
- **Warnings**: Whether the pilot was warned of wildlife presence.
- **Cost**: Financial impact of the strike.
- **Injuries**: Number of people injured.
- **Aircraft Size**: Indicates if the aircraft was large.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the patterns, trends, and key insights from the data.
- **Dashboard Development**: Create an interactive dashboard to visualize the data and facilitate deeper analysis.

## Features of the Dashboard

- **Incident Distribution**: Visual representation of bird strike incidents across different airports and altitudes.
- **Impact Analysis**: Analysis of the effects on flights, including damage caused and financial costs.
- **Wildlife Information**: Insights into the types of wildlife involved and their sizes.
- **Weather Conditions**: Correlation between sky conditions and bird strike incidents.
- **Temporal Trends**: Trends over the years to identify any significant changes or patterns.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Data cleaning and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Handling and manipulating the dataset.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Visualizations for exploratory data analysis.
- **Power BI/Tableau**: Dashboard creation and interactive visualizations.
